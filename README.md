## EXECUTION

- Nigel smiling on homepage: Photo by Stefan Stefancik: https://www.pexels.com/photo/man-on-gray-shirt-portrait-91227/
- Wording of homepage main content assisted by Chat GPT with the prompt: "Pretend you are inviting your friends to your birthday party. You are called Nigel, you are a man turning 25 years old. It should be a paragraph long"
- Font Awesome used for icons: https://fontawesome.com/
- W3 schools for making a responsive iframe for my youtube video: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_responsive_iframes.asp
- All Bar One photo from: https://www.allbarone.co.uk/national-search/south-east/all-bar-one-brighton#/
- How to style tables: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_table_borders.asp
- Wording of details main content assisted by Chat GPT, asking it to write my paragraph in the same voice as the homepage. My content before: Here is all the information you'll need to turn up in the right place at the right time! The axe throwing activity is optional so you can just turn up to the bar part if you like, or even join us for the activity but duck out after. It'd be lovely to see you at either or both! Make sure you tell me which its you'll be attending via the RSVP form. Cheers all.
